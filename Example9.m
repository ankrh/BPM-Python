% This example shows the propagation of an LP mode in a multimode fiber.
% The MMF is divided into four segments, where the first and last are
% straight, the second is bent in the x direction and the third is bent in
% the y direction. Plotting of the mode overlaps has been enabled by
% setting P.calcModeOverlaps = true. Due to symmetry, the modes with odd
% parity are not excited in the first two segments despite the bending.

% We use the getLabeledModeIdx() function to find out which index in the
% P.modes array correponds to a particular mode label (LP01, LP11e, etc.)

%% General and solver-related settings
P.name = mfilename;
P.useAllCPUs = true; % If false, BPM-Matlab will leave one processor unused. Useful for doing other work on the PC while simulations are running.
P.useGPU = false; % (Default: false) Use CUDA acceleration for NVIDIA GPUs

%% Visualization parameters
P.calcModeOverlaps = true;  % Set it to true to calculate mode overlap integrals of propagating field with respect to different modes in the P.modes struct array
