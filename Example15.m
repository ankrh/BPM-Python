% This example shows that the mode finder can correctly find the LPlm
% labels even of modes of nonstandard radially symmetric refractive index
% distributions.
% 
% The refractive index is chosen to approximate that of Figure 3 of
% https://www.rp-photonics.com/lp_modes.html. In the plot on the RP
% photonics site, the black curves correspond to the LP01 and LP02 modes,
% the red to the LP11 and LP12 modes, the green to the LP21 modes and the
% blue to the LP31 modes. Good agreement is seen between the modes found in
% the mode finder of BPM-Matlab and the modes on the RP site. Also, the
% LPlm labels found by BPM-Matlab (shown in the figure titles of the
% plotted modes) are correct. Interestingly, we see the LP01 mode exhibit a
% local minimum at the core center, a feature that is never present in the
% LP0m modes of step-index core fibers.
% 
% Plotting of the refractive index is added to the RI function for
% visualization.
% 
% The beam propagator is not run in this example.
