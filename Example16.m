% This example shows offset and tilt of the E field in MMF splices.
% 
% First, the fundamental mode is injected into a step index MMF. Then,
% after the first segment, we simulate a bad splice by offsetting the beam
% by 4 Âµm in a 45 degrees direction (towards upper right) using the
% offsetField() function. The mode overlaps can be seen to change
% instantaneously at this splice. Next, after segment 2, another bad splice
% is simulated, in which segments 2 and 3 are at an angle of 2 degrees.
% Here we use the tiltField() function. Again, the mode overlaps change.
% 
% The phase gradient that tiltField() applies to the field depends on what
% the refractive index is in the wedge between the segments. tiltField
% assumes that the refractive index is uniformly equal to P.n_0, which
% should be a good approximation for weakly guiding fibers.
